    "Programming functions in Python can be a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's pretty awesome when you're able to put together an effective and robust function and immediately put it to use, but at the same time, functions can also be a bit of a nightmare to debug since they're so stingy about throwing errors sometimes. Part of the problem is Python's own occasional leniency when it comes to local and global variables: often, these make us _think_ our function is doing just fine when in reality it needs substantially more tweaking before being appropriate for general use (and also appropriate as a test answer).\n",

Otherwise, they shouldn't be there - and given that for the purposes of this course, we give you the local variables for a function as part of the question prompt, they very much should be there as far as the test is concerned.
