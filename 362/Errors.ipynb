    "## Common Python Errors\n",
    "#### (and, more importantly, how to fix them)\n",
    "---\n",
    "When starting out with programming, errors can be the absolute bane of one's existence. It's an awful feeling to write a bunch of seemingly good code and then get totally stumped by some random incomprehensible error. My code looks correct! Why isn't it working the way it's supposed to??\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, as programming languages go, Python is actually very informative when it comes to errors. The error message Python raises has a straightforward and consistent format that is easy to read once you understand how to navigate it. What this actually means is that learning how to interpret error messages can actually help us pinpoint what went wrong and immediately address it in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general format of a Python error message is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "    <ipython-input-2-920d7b6164de> in <module>()\n",
    "    ----> 1 print(my_list[3])\n",
    "\n",
    "    IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what each part of this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)`\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top, Python tells us that this is an `IndexError`, which we'll explain below. As you become more familiar with the different types of errors, you'll find that just hearing the term `IndexError` will be enough to prime your head for the kind of error there is in your code. However, it's often not the full story, which is why Python also includes what's called a _Traceback_ pointing to the exact line of code that triggered the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<ipython-input-2-920d7b6164de> in <module>()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`----> 1 print(my_list[3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "On the second line, we see some Python-isms for the source code behind the error. For our purposes, this isn't something to spend too much time looking at. What's more helpful, however, is the next line, which you'll notice starts with a `---->`. This arrow points to the exact line that caused the error, and starts with its line number to boot (in this case, 1) to help make it easier for you to find in the code. (You can also toggle line numbers for a single cell in Jupyter using View -> Toggle Line numbers, or Control-M followed by L if you're a keyboard shortcut person)\n",
    "\n",
    "`IndexError: list index out of range`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the error message ends off with a more detailed explanation of `IndexError`. In this case, Python's telling us that the provided 'list index [is] out of range', which - in tandem with the line of code being pointed to above - we can use to deduce that we're probably providing an incorrect index to our list there. "

   "source": [
    "Error messages are sometimes longer than this, including multiple different tracebacks. This especially happens when your error has to do with a package, like `SeqIO`. Don't be scared off by the larger number of tracebacks - it's often just Python also showing you the source code for whatever caused the error, just in case that extra information might help you figure out what went wrong. For the purposes of this course, that source code probably won't be very informative to us, so it's best to focus on the traceback that features our own code and use that to identify the source of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to mention is that Jupyter code cells are run _top to bottom_ - so if there are multiple errors in your code, Python will only return an error message and traceback for the very first error. After you correct it, you might see a totally different error message pointing at a line of code further down. Don't panic! This is just Python trying to help you fix errors one at a time, and doesn't necessarily mean that fixing the first error broke something else (although it sometimes might...). In all cases, grab your detective cap and try to be patient, even if that feels like a tall order at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this notebook, we'll be walking through common errors you might see, what the most common interpretations we can make of them are, and what the culprits often tend to be. These are presented as 'the simplest possible case' of the error, with the aim of presenting the logic behind why Python reports a certain error type for a given circumstance. If you see these errors in your actual code, try to think back to these 'simplest possible case' examples - ultimately, the exact same problem happening in these is happening in some way in your code, which also means they can often be resolved the same way."
